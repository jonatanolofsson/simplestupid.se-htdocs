# Onboard Sensors
Sensors are fun! And I believe it shows considering the following list of onboard sensors:

 - [10 DOF IMU](01.imu.md)
     - 3D accelerometers
     - 3D gyroscopes
     - 3D magnetometer
     - Barometric pressure sensor
 - [Wind sensors](02.wind.md)
 - [10 Hz GPS](03.gps.md)
 - [Single camera Visual SLAM](04.camera.md)
 - [Optical Flow](05.optical_flow.md)
 - [Tachometer](06.tachometer.md)


All these sensors are fed into a non-linear Kalman filtering algorithm, 
modified to accomodate for the varying sample rates of the different sensors.

More information on each sensor can be found on each of the pages.
