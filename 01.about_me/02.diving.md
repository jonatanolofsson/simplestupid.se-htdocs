# Scuba Diving
In the fall of 2013, my close friend Erik Levholt convinced my to take the Open Water diving certificate.
In the end, he couldn't go, but I took the course anyway together with my now wife, Anna!

Even though I was anxious to learn to dive, little did I know how hooked we would become!
We both got ourselves a full diving gear, suitable for our northern waters and
now, less than a year later, we are both studying for our fifth diving course here in Link√∂ping, to be certified as rescue divers.
Safety first, you know, so it's best to know what to do if there's an accident!
