# System Implementation
The part of the software I have named helisys, is the somewhat generalized implementations 
of the algorithms that I use, and the specialized instantiation of these.

Modules are implemented as C++ templates, which are then instantiated to shorten
build times. This gives both the advantage of generalized C++ template programming,
and the modular build process of instantiations.

*Template definition in MotionControl.hpp:*
```
:::C++
template<...>
class MotionControl {
    ...
}
```

*Template instatiation in instantiation.cpp*
```
:::C++
template class MotionControl<...>;
```

*Algorithm implementation in implementation.hpp*
```
:::C++
template<...>
void MotionControl<...>
::updateControl(const SystemState systemState, const ReferenceMessage referenceMessage) {
    ...
}
```

# Main Algorithm Graph Overview

# State Machine
A state in helisys is represented as modules instantiated in memory, which form as executable graph.
This is implemented using the [Boost Statechart](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_56_0/libs/statechart/doc/index.html) library,
and each instantiation is simply a member variable of a class that gets instantiated when a state is entered. 
Thus, e.g. the motion control module does not even get initialized until the first pre-flight checks have allowed
the system to enter an appropriate state.
