# The Helicopter Project
This is my largest project ever attempted and is still, several years down the road, a very rewarding project in that so many
new sub-projects can be spawned and pursued.
This website is intended to be a both technical and accessible documentation of the project.

In some ways, this project is a statue over my stubborn will to keep doing practical
electrical engineering combined with advanced automatic control. 
Although I have less time to work on the project since I met my wife and started working, 
I continue to work on the implementation details just to learn new things! 

One of its major strengths as a project, is as a foundation for learning new 
techniques, new programming skills and electrical engineering.
One can take practically any engineering skill and apply it to the helicopter
as a practical example and actually implementing these things you read about!

Through the years, I've had the oppurtunity to learn loads of new stuff on the helicopter from
implementing

 - low-level serial protocols, 
 - microprocessor serial communication drivers,
 - designing and ordering manufactured circuit-boards,
 - advanced non-linear multivariable automatic control,
 - non-linear state estimation
 - et.c.

And it is not even limited to technical issues. I have had several presentations
about this project, allowing me to practice those skills. 
I have looked at requirement management software for this project - not something
you do for your average hobby.

## Background
My hobby with working on the helicopter project began during my years at the univerity. 
Together with my friends, we built several robots - all under the common device of ''How Hard Can It Be?'' - and we had loads of hard work
but even more fun! During the later years, I became inspired with getting my own helicopter to fly, and began to focus my studies
toward automatic control and sensor fusion. 

## Source Control
All source code for this project is available on [my github](https://github.com/jonatanolofsson/helicopter).

## Design Overview
While the algorithms used aim to be quite advanced, the basic design of the helicopter is actually quite simple.
The lower level electrical details are handled by a microcontroller responsible for sampling sensors and feeding servo signals.
This acts as an abstraction layer against the Linux-equipped main computer, which also interacts with an identical twin which is occupied with vision processing and SLAM techniques.
They are connected through simple serial connections, and standard hardware solutions are used where I felt for it.

The helicopter is a 650-class helicopter bought part-by-part from [HobbyKing](http://www.hobbyking.com) and the processors
are manufactured by [HardKernel](http://www.hardkernel.com) (Odroid U2 4xCortex A9 @ 1.7-2.0 GHz) and [LeafLabs](http://www.leaflabs.com) (Maple Mini, Cortex-M3 @ 72 MHz)
respectively. The vision processor uses a modified version of the [PTAM](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~gk/PTAM/) library, which i developed during my Master's thesis.
