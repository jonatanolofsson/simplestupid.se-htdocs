# Simulator Concepts
A simulator is a vital part of developing a product which *will* kill itself if a flight ends badly.
It's a simple matter of economics, I simply cannot afford not to test my implementation thoroughly.

Different tests require different part of the "real" system to be included. Some tests require the entire
assembled helicopter to run, whereas many tests can run in a smaller loop.

Much work has been put into making sure the algorithmic tests can be run reproducibly at a much
higher wall clock speed than real-time. This requires strict synchronization and always doing things
in the same order - even in a heavily multithreaded environment.
